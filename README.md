# Where art thou, my error?

This is my talk at [GraphQL Finland 2018](https://graphql-finland.fi) that gives both an overview of patterns being used
to surface errors that occur during GraphQL query execution, as well as what _our_ (artsy.net) approach is.

You can find the slides on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/alloy/where-art-thou-my-error) or as PDF in
[this repo](presentation.pdf).

Finally, you can find a recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKA-n8p-sNc) and a blog post version [here](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/10/19/where-art-thou-my-error/)—where
you can also leave comments with your feedback on all of this 🙏
