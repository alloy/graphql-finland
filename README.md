# Where art thou, my error?

## Exceptions vs User Errors

## Possible solutions

### Top level errors and treating a complete response as unusable when such errors exist

### Top level errors and working those back into the schema on the client-side

### Make errors part of schema as separate field on object that had error

### Make errors part of schema using a union

## Our choice and how we encode it into the schema

### Limitation of scalar types not fitting in unions

## Example of how we consume the errors in our schema
